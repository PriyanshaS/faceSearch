# Face Search App
#### This GitHub repository for the FaceSearch app contains a comprehensive backend and frontend implementation for a facial recognition application built using Flutter and Node.js. The backend, powered by Express.js and MongoDB, offers robust image upload and retrieval functionality, seamlessly handling user uploads and serving image data via RESTful API endpoints. Leveraging Multer middleware, our backend ensures efficient file handling during image uploads. On the frontend, the Flutter app boasts an attractive user interface designed with Flutter's rich set of widgets, adhering to Material Design principles for a polished and intuitive user experience. Users can effortlessly upload images from their devices, triggering HTTP requests to the backend API. The app gracefully handles API responses and implements error handling to address network issues and server errors. With smooth transitions and dynamic image display, our app captivates users as it cycles through fetched images every 2 seconds.
